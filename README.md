# Vendors
The Angular single page application (SPA) for vendors to submit invoices.

A vendor is a dance instructor, or contractor that works for the studio.
Once a month, a vendor will submit an invoice to the dance studio for payment.

## Use Cases
1. Vendor can sign up
2. Vendor can submit an invoice
3. Vendor can view past submitted invoices

## Developer Setup
1. `yarn` restore dependencies
2. `yarn start` run the app at `localhost:4200`
  * note, you cannot run this app and `ng-studios` at the same time because they use the same port
